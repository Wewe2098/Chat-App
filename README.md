I used XD for wireframing and it's not a lot of frames since I'll be creating a chatting app
    
    Frontend:
        How it looks: We'll use Create React App to build how the website looks and behaves and Vito.
        Making it pretty: We'll style it using CSS and possibly tools like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS to make it look good without too much effort.

    Backend:
        How it works: We'll use Express.js to handle the behind-the-scenes stuff like dealing with data and sending it to the frontend.
        Storing data: We'll use MongoDB, a type of database, to store information like user accounts or posts.
        adding cookies and JWL.

    Where it lives:
        I'll see if use Vercel or Render for my project


The App will work the same as Whatsapp but you will need to singup and login.

How it works

* You signup and easy like that , you'll be on the app.
*the more people that sign up the more people you'll see on your contacts.
*you can start chatting to anyone

You can see the Wireframes on the XD doc attached.
